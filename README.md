This game is implemented with SFML library. In this library there's no default font and because of this you need change path to your font in `ui.cpp` file in constructor.

The level of AI is hard. To decrease level you need change max velocity in `enemy.h`.

After downloading you should type `make` to compile project and execute `main` file.
